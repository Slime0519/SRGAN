# SRGAN

## Description
This repository contains my implementation RefSR method proposed in [Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04802)

### Generator
![](/Description_image/Generator.png)
    
Generator is also called SRResNet.    
It has 5 Residual blocks (simpler version), and reconstruct image by pixelshuffler(a.k.a subpixel convolutional layer)
 proposed in [ “Real-Time Single Image and Video Super-Resolution Using an Efficient Sub-Pixel Convolutional Neural Network (CVPR 2016)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05158.pdf)
  

### Discriminator
![](/Description_image/Discriminator.png)
   
Discriminator has ordinary structure like traditional Discriminator of GAN.<br>
It has Sequential ( Conv + BN + LeakyReLU ) blocks and downsample input image alternately.   

### Perceptual loss
Proposed in [Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.08155) paper<br>
![](/Description_image/VGGLoss.png)<br>
To improve perceptual quality of result images, SRGAN use perceptual loss(a.k.a VGG loss).
This function compare two feature map extracted intermediate layer in pretrained VGG-19 network, we can easily implement this function. 
I used pytorch internal library and extract feature map easily.<br>
